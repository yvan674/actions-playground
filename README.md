Monorepo structured repo to play around and test github actions.

## Why?

Man, GitHub Actions are hard, especially multi-step workflows.
If you think they aren't hats off to you but for everyone else, I think it's fair to say that CI/CD is hard to set up in the first place.

We don't want to actually mess up the main repo with all of this mess, so I made a new repo just to test out how this works.
I'm happy to say, it does now!
